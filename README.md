But you are free to build your own lobby as well or you can just expand the existing lobby.

All players are automatically in the adventure game mode in the lobby.

## Mining Dimension

The mining dimension will be generated on the first load over the `/mining` command.
It will not include any treasure chest or any mobs, so it could be only use for mining.
(This could be changed over the config file, if needed.)

You will start in a mining base which provides you some of the basic stuff.
To return to the mining base just use the `/mining` command.

## FAQ

### How can I reset a dimension ?

Just delete the dimension and the starting bases will be automatically regenerated after the server restart.

Relevant folders:

- dimensions/lobby/fishing_dimension
- dimensions/lobby/lobby_dimension
- dimensions/lobby/mining_dimension

### How can I reset the default bases like the mining base, fishing base or the spawn without resetting the dimension ?

Teleport to the corresponding dimension and run the corresponding functions like:

- `/function lobby:fishing_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:lobby_dimension_load`
- `/function lobby:mining_dimension_load`

**Note: This will overwrite any existing block, but no entities see <https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-102430>.**

### How can I remove all entities from the mining dimension from other Mods ?

Just use the following admin command: `/execute in lobby:mining_dimension run kill @e[type=!player,distance=0..]`

### The users are not instantly transferred to the lobby dimension on their first join. Any way to fix this ?

Unfortunately to avoid any side effects with other mods, the user needs first to join the overworld so that all mods are able to sync their data.
As soon these data are synced the user could be transferred to the lobby dimension without any issues.

### Will there are 1.16.5 version ?

There are already a lot of dimension mods for 1.16.5 which are covering similar functionality like:

- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-mining-dimension>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools-dimensions>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aroma1997s-dimensional-world>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dimensionaldoors>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hunting-dimension>
- <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-team-islands-forge>

I see not really any reason why there should be "another" dimension mod for 1.16.5, which only provides the basic functionality.

### Will there are fabric version ?

Unfortunately I have no time to work on a separate fabric version.
