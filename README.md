## Lobby Dimension

But you are free to build your own lobby as well or you can just expand the existing lobby.

All players are automatically in the adventure game mode in the lobby.

## Mining Dimension

The mining dimension will be generated on the first load over the `/mining` command.
It will not include any treasure chest or any mobs, so it could be only use for mining.
(This could be changed over the config file, if needed.)

You will start in a mining base which provides you some of the basic stuff.
To return to the mining base just use the `/mining` command.

**Note:** The first load of the dimension could take some time, because the need to generate the world and preparing the spawning area.

## FAQ

### How can I remove all entities from the mining dimension from other Mods?

Just use the following admin command: `/execute in lobby:mining_dimension run kill @e[type=!player,distance=0..]`

### Will there are 1.16.5 version ?

There are already a lot of dimension mods for 1.16.5 which are covering similar functionality like:

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advanced-mining-dimension
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools-dimensions
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rftools
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aroma1997s-dimensional-world
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dimensionaldoors
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hunting-dimension
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-team-islands-forge

I see not really any reason why there should be "another" dimension mod for 1.16.5, which only provides the basic functionality.
